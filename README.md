# 323 Database Fundamentals

Project Date: Feb-2023 to April-2023

# Description

This repository is to show one of the final projects assigned from my database class. For this python project, I had to develop a wrappers using SQLAlchemy for users so that they can interact with the PostgreSQL school database develop by the teacher. To note this is not actually use commercially for the school; this is just a private 
assignment reviewed by the teacher. To also note is that the Postgre database no longer exist since it was only temporary for the class, so currently this project will not work with respect to the fact that there is no longer a connection to be made.

This project was not fully developed from scratch; a main aspect was that the teacher initially provided sample code to work with at the start. What essentially the teacher provided in code were the main 
connection to the database, the initial main function the user interacted with and some helper function, and some of the init for the table classes. The students' goal is to understand this code so that they can effectively integrate new tables to the sample code.

This entire project was split off into multiple chronological assignments during the beginning of the class, that each iteratively build off one another; they build off one another by adding new tables. For this repository, I only included my final iteration for the SQL database which includes the entirety of the roadmap.

I will admit that it may be confusing determining which part of the code I or my teacher developed. To help with this, I wanted to include the original sample code my teacher provided so that it is possible to see which parts differ. However, I no longer have access to the final sample code for the final iteration.
Instead I included the sample code for a previous iteration and this will include a good majority to help determine the teacher's part in the work (The database connection, main function, etc...). To also help, for my code, I added placemarker in the file names where I knew I had to change/include my own code.
This placemarker is "[Class Name]_C.py". Essentially this were files that handled the classes for new tables I needed to integrate, and the user interface in the main function in main.
